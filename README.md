# Slime Mould Simulation

A simulation of a slime mould (Physarum polycephalum) based on [this paper](https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579), with additional guidance from [Sage Jenson's](https://cargocollective.com/sagejenson/physarum) writeup.

Two variations of the sim are also included.

### Resources
The original paper explored how the simulation could be used to solve a shortest path problem. This is done by placing fixed points that attract the organisms. The collective will eventually find an efficient path to connect all of the points.

### Avoidant Species
By distinguishing the organisms by colour, they can be programmed to avoid different species, resulting in more complicated patters and behaviours.
